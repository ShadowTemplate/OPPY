# One Project Per Year (OPPY)

OPPY is my meta-project started in 2014. Every year I try to complete (at 
least) one personal project to add some value to my life. Projects can be of 
different kinds: technical side projects, personal challenges, good habits. I
firmly believe that engaging in this projects has a positive impact on my life
and makes me a better scientist, a better friend and, overall, a better person.

Further details can be found in the lightning-talk I gave for 
[Speck&Tech](http://speckand.tech/) in Trento. It was my first public speech, 
do not be too severe with me. Here you can find 
[the presentation](
https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY/blob/master/Speck%26Tech%20talk/Speck%26Tech%20presentation%20-%20OPPY:%20on%20the%20importance%20of%20personal%20projects.pdf), 
[my notes](
https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY/blob/master/Speck%26Tech%20talk/Speck%26Tech%20notes%20-%20OPPY:%20on%20the%20importance%20of%20personal%20projects.txt) 
and [the video]() (X:XX).

*Sharing is caring.* In this repository you can find further details about my 
annual projects.
Some of them are still ongoing.

I sincerely hope OPPY could inspire you to **follow your passions and your 
dreams**.

## Asimov - *2018, April* (ongoing)

> *Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is.* -
Isaac Asimov

This is a famous quote I have heard from a former senior dev colleague and that I
am starting to understand only now.
After my master's degree I have become even more responsible of my own 
education.
In a similar way to [#50weeksofTED](
https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY#50weeksofted---2015-october-completed) 
I will try to spend the vast majority of my 
spare time reading scientific papers of different kinds.
This time the task is way harder.

I usually read each paper twice: the first time to grasp a general idea, the 
second to highlight the most important concepts.
Then, I classify them by year and title in [my ring binder](
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY/master/pictures/ring_binder.jpg).


In the [project folder](
https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY/tree/master/Asimov) you can find the 
[talks I have already read](
https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY/blob/master/Asimov/list.txt) for the 
project, [those read in the past years](
https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY/blob/master/Asimov/legacy/list.txt
) that I will retro-classify, 
[those dropped](
https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY/blob/master/Asimov/dropped/list.txt
) and [my current reading list](
https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY/blob/master/Asimov/queue/list.txt
).

I have developed [a simple tool](
https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/arxiv-downloader) to easily download papers 
from [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/), the main source I use.

If you have anything interesting to suggest, feel free to share!

Thanks Ramzi for having inspired me.

## Elric - *2017, January* (completed)

This project tells a story about brotherhood, on how I have reconnected with 
Checco after 2 years away from home.
Together we have achieved our childhood dream and completed our Pok√©mon card 
collection started in 1999, when we were 6 and 4.
We have spent countless hours together, especially during Christmas and Easter, 
trying to figure out how to collect and show the cards (over 200) and building 
the frame.
This is a story of eBay auctions won at night, of a continuous flow of packages
from the postal service, of repetitive work, such as cutting 1000 adhesive 
corners.
It is a story of friendship as well, since nothing would have been possible 
without some friends and the [NErdeST](
https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY#nerdest---2016-april-ongoing) gifting us 
with their cards.

[This is the epic final results](
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY/master/pictures/elric_final.jpg), 
with the [base set](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Base_Set_(TCG)), 
[Jungle](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Jungle_(TCG)) and [Fossil](
https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Fossil_(TCG)).

## NErdeST - *2016, April* (ongoing)

TODO.

## #dayoff - *2016, January* (ongoing)

The first day of every month I keep my mobile phone turned off.
This is a wonderful habit I always respect and highly recommend.
It is a way to detoxify from technology and get more in contact with people.
In addition, I have rediscovered some little pleasures coming from situations 
that are disappearing in modern society.
It is really hard to explain how engaging and funny can be common things such 
as travelling or eating.
Just try and try and try again, you will slowly understand what I mean.
Ah, sorry but... never expect *"Happy New Year!"* from me.

## #50weeksofTED - *2015, October* (completed)

For 50 weeks I have spent the vast majority of my spare time watching 
[TED](https://www.ted.com/) talks.
In the end I have watched over 140 talks (35 hours circa) and participated to 
three live TEDx events in Italy.
I have [tweeted all of them to keep a history](
https://twitter.com/search?l=&q=%2350weeksofTED%20from%3Adjanvito) 
([txt version](
https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY/blob/master/%2350weeksofTED/TED%20talks%20list.txt)) 
and also managed to [rank them](
https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY/blob/master/%2350weeksofTED/TED%20talks%20ranking.txt
) (that was hard!).

Even one single TED talk can influence your life, imagine 140.
Moreover, during the year I have always had a lot of really nice conversation 
topics and also the sensation to understand more profoundly the world around 
me.
I have successfully engaged my friends in this experience and I still love 
watching new talks.

Recently I have developed [a simple tool](
https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/ted-downloader) to easily download talks from 
the official website.

TED deserve your time and your support: **keep worthy ideas spreading**.

## Computer Scientists :floppy_disk: - *2015, October* (ongoing)

Many people consider chat groups annoying and they tend to run away from them 
as soon as possible or, if not possibile, mute them (typically forever).
I consider many of my groups an invaluable asset.
In 2015, after my bachelor's degree, I created a group with many university 
colleagues in order to keep in touch and, most of all, share interesting ideas,
articles, news, advices, and, why not, jokes. No spam, no flooding.
I learn a lot from them and, even more important, [we still periodically 
reunite away from keyboard](
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY/master/pictures/computer_scientists.jpg).
Thanks guys, you are awesome.

## Xantudd's Kennel - *2014, June* (completed)

During summer, I developed a website for my friend Nino, an afghan hounds 
breeder in my hometown, Bari. It was my first real experience with CSS, HTML 
and JavaScript, despite having attended over twenty university courses for my
bachelor's degree in computer science. The final result was not for sure 
extraordinary, but the customer was very satisfied and that was enough for me.
I also earned some money I later spent for my modest 
[LEGO collection](
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShadowTemplate/OPPY/master/pictures/lego_collection.jpg).

If you need some puppies, take a look at 
[Xantudd's Kennel](http://www.xantudds.com/)!
